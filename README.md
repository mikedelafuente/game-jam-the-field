The Field: Manage a field to attract animals and build an ecosystem

## The Idea
Create a field that has a single bunny in it. Put plants in the field to attract more animals.

Loop:
	- Create plants that attract animals
	- Animals eat what is growing
	- Provide possible water sources
	- Animals could get eaten by predators
