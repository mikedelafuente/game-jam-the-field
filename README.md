The Field: Manage a field to attract animals and build an ecosystem

## The story
Jose comes home from the city after his father has passed away - years after losing his mother. 
He arrives at a field with his father's ashes and a note to spread them under his father's favorite tree.

The Field is about loss, loneliness, and the discovery of a community. Jose has a cell phone with a final voicemail from his father.
There are photes on it, many taken with his father and him at the field, and as time goes back there are pictures with his mother and father.

There is his sister in some photos, an old pet, and some pictures from the city.

The field is about returning home, but never really being able to return home - things have changed.

But as the game progresses, it is less about the loss and more about the gaining of community. Jose gains a best friend in a dog who is horrible about retrieving a ball. 

The Field is not vibrant like it was when Jose was young. 

Perhaps he falls asleep under the tree where he spreads the ashes and then the Field becomes surrounded in trees.

It isn't a Stardew Valley game - it is about gaining community and having an impact by helping others.
It is about slowing down and taking moments to appreciate where you came from.





## The Idea
Create a field that has a single bunny in it. Put plants in the field to attract more animals.

Loop:
	- Create plants that attract animals
	- Animals eat what is growing
	- Provide possible water sources
	- Animals could get eaten by predators

To D
	- Emit particles when walking


Create a field where animals are attracted to you

- Have a chest holding a ball in it
	- pick up the ball
	- throw the ball
	- A dog appears and grabs the ball, returning it to you
	- IT starts to follow you
	- You see a mound of dirt
	- throw the ball near the mound
	- The dog digs up the dirt
	- There is a jar of seeds
	- You can remove the seeds from the jar
	- the jar can be used to catch fireflies at night for a lamp
	- Maybe you find a note in a backpack about building a new home for yourself
